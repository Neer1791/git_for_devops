  - `ls`: Lists files in the current directory.
  - `ls -l`: Detailed list view, showing file permissions, size, and date.
  - `ls -a`: Shows hidden files as well (those starting with `.`).

- **Navigating directories:**
  - `cd /`: Changes to the root directory.
  - `cd /home/ubuntu/`: Changes to the `ubuntu` user directory.
  - `cd scripts/`: Moves into the `scripts` directory.

- **Creating directories:**
  - `mkdir scripts`: Creates a new directory named `scripts`.
  - `mkdir git-for-devops`: Creates a `git-for-devops` directory.

- **Creating files:**
  - `touch file1.txt file2.txt`: Creates two empty files, `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`.
  - `touch file3.txt`: Creates an empty file named `file3.txt`.
  - `touch uatfile.txt`: Creates an empty file named `uatfile.txt`.

- **Viewing file contents:**
  - `cat authorized_keys`: Displays the contents of the `authorized_keys` file.
  - `cat hello.txt`: Shows the content of the `hello.txt` file.

- **Removing files:**
  - `rm file1.txt`: Deletes `file1.txt` from the directory.

- **Editing files:**
  - `vim hello.sh`: Opens or creates the `hello.sh` script for editing using Vim.
  - `vim hello.txt`: Opens or creates the `hello.txt` file.
  - `vim file1.txt`: Edits `file1.txt` in Vim editor.

**Bash Prompt for Learning:**
```bash
# Navigate to the desired directory
cd /home/ubuntu/

# Create and list a new directory
mkdir my_project
ls

# Create a new script and edit it with vim
touch my_script.sh
vim my_script.sh
# Inside Vim, press 'i' to insert and write your bash script, e.g.:
# #!/bin/bash
# echo "Hello, world!"
# Save and exit: press 'ESC', then type ':wq' and press Enter

# View the contents of the script
cat my_script.sh
```

**Note:** Understanding how to manage files and directories is essential for automating tasks and scripting in Linux. The use of `vim` helps in directly editing files, while `ls`, `cat`, and `rm` help in managing file contents and structure.

### 2. **System Information and Disk Usage**

- **Disk space usage:**
  - `df -h`: Shows the disk space usage in a human-readable format.

- **Viewing system status:**
  - `systemctl status nginx.service`: Displays the status of the NGINX service, whether it's running, stopped, or failed.

**Bash Prompt for Learning:**
```bash
# Check available disk space
df -h

# View the status of a system service
sudo systemctl status nginx.service
```

**Note:** `df -h` helps you keep track of disk usage, especially when you're running out of space. `systemctl` is critical for managing services on Linux systems.

---

### 3. **Package Management (Ubuntu)**

- **Update and upgrade system:**
  - `sudo apt-get update`: Updates the list of available packages and their versions.
  - `sudo apt upgrade`: Installs newer versions of the packages you have.

- **Installing and removing software:**
  - `sudo apt-get install nginx`: Installs the NGINX web server.
  - `sudo apt purge nginx`: Removes the NGINX package from the system.

**Bash Prompt for Learning:**
```bash
# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Upgrade all installed packages
sudo apt upgrade

# Install a new package (e.g., nginx)
sudo apt-get install nginx

# Remove a package (e.g., nginx)
sudo apt purge nginx
```

**Note:** Regular updates are crucial for security patches and package improvements. Using `apt-get` allows you to manage software efficiently.

---

### 4. **System Administration**

- **Checking and managing services:**
  - `systemctl status nginx.service`: Checks the status of the NGINX service.
  - `sudo systemctl start nginx.service`: Starts the NGINX service.
  - `sudo systemctl stop nginx.service`: Stops the NGINX service.

- **Viewing command history:**
  - `history`: Shows the list of commands previously executed in the terminal.

**Bash Prompt for Learning:**
```bash
# Start and stop a service (e.g., nginx)
sudo systemctl start nginx.service
sudo systemctl stop nginx.service

# View the history of commands
history
```

**Note:** Understanding how to control system services is crucial for system administrators. Knowing how to start, stop, and check the status of services keeps your system in check.

---

### 5. **Networking Commands**

- **Incorrect usage:**
  - `sysctl staus nginx` (corrected as `sysctl status nginx`): This command attempts to view NGINX's status, though `systemctl` is usually preferred for managing services.

**Bash Prompt for Learning:**
```bash
# Correct way to check status of nginx using systemctl
systemctl status nginx
```

**Note:** System and network administrators often use `systemctl` for managing services, which includes monitoring networking services like NGINX.

---

### 6. **Bash Scripting**

- **Checking bash path:**
  - `which bash`: Displays the path to the bash binary.

- **Creating and running a bash script:**
  - `vim hello.sh`: Edits a bash script file.
  - `chmod 774 hello.sh`: Grants read, write, and execute permissions to the owner and others on `hello.sh`.
  - `./hello.sh`: Executes the `hello.sh` script.

**Bash Prompt for Learning:**
```bash
# Check where the bash interpreter is located
which bash

# Create and run a simple bash script
vim hello.sh
# Inside the script, you can write:
# #!/bin/bash
# echo "Hello, World!"
chmod 774 hello.sh
./hello.sh
```

**Note:** Writing and executing bash scripts allows for task automation, which is a fundamental skill for any Linux user.

  - `git commit -m "adding file1 and file2"`: Commits staged changes with a message.

- **Branching:**
  - `git checkout -b dev`: Creates and switches to a new branch named `dev`.
  - `git branch`: Lists all branches in the repository.

**Bash Prompt for Learning:**
```bash
# Initialize a new git repository
git init

# Set global config details
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"

# Add files to the staging area and commit
git add file1.txt
git commit -m "First commit"

# View the git log in a compact format
git log --oneline

# Create a new branch and switch to it
git checkout -b feature_branch
```

**Note:** Git is vital for version control, making it easier to track changes, collaborate, and manage branches. These commands are frequently used for everyday Git workflows.
